# Introduction to GitHub and GitHub Pages

**GitHub** is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration using **Git**. While it's traditionally used by software developers, us mechanical engineers can greatly benefit from it too, especially when managing code, simulations, or documentation. 
GitHub helps you track changes, collaborate with others, and manage versions of your projects, making it invaluable for both individual and team efforts.

## What is GitHub?

- **Version Control**: GitHub helps you manage and track different versions of your files (e.g., CAD files, simulation scripts, or project documentation) without losing any previous versions.
- **Collaboration**: It allows multiple team members to work on the same project and keep track of who made what changes.
- **Backup**: With your files hosted on GitHub, they are safely stored online, reducing the risk of losing your work due to local storage failures.

## What is GitHub Pages?

**GitHub Pages** is a free feature provided by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. You can use it to create a **personal website** or **project portfolios** to showcase your work.

## Why GitHub Pages is Great for Hosting Personal Websites

1. **Free Hosting**: GitHub Pages provides free web hosting for your website without requiring any backend setup or extra payments.
   
2. **Easy to Use**: With simple tools like **Markdown** or **HTML**, you can create and update your website directly in your GitHub repository. You don't need deep knowledge of web development.

3. **Custom Domain Support**: If you want a professional touch, you can link your custom domain (e.g., `yourname.com`) to your GitHub Pages site.

4. **Perfect for Portfolios**: As a mechanical engineer, you can showcase your projects, research, or engineering designs. For example:
   - Share CAD models, FEA results, or MATLAB simulations.
   - Display photos, descriptions, and progress on your engineering projects.

5. **Version Control for Your Website**: Just like any other project in GitHub, you can track changes, revert to earlier versions, and collaborate with others to update your website.

## How to Create a GitHub Pages Website

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**:  
   Go to GitHub and create a new repository. Name it `yourusername.github.io` (replace `yourusername` with your GitHub handle).
   
2. **Add Website Files**:  
   Create a basic HTML or Markdown file (e.g., `index.html` or `README.md`) and commit it to the repository. This will be your homepage.

3. **Publish Your Website**:  
   After adding your files, GitHub will automatically generate your site. Visit `https://yourusername.github.io` to see it live!
